# Full-Stack-Project
This is a modern, full-stack blog application built using Reflex, a Python-based web framework for building reactive frontends with zero JavaScript. The project showcases how to leverage Reflex for creating a clean, dynamic, and fully functional blog platformâ€”from frontend rendering to backend state management.

Key features include:
      Markdown-based blog post rendering
      Fully reactive frontend powered by Reflex
      Dynamic routing and post loading
      Simple file- or database-based post management
      Extensible design for theming, comments, and more

This repository serves both as a learning resource and a starter template for anyone looking to build content-driven web apps with Reflex.
