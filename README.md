# Full-Stack-Project
This is a contemporary, full-stack blog application developed with Reflex, a Python web framework for developing reactive frontends with no JavaScript. The project demonstrates how to use Reflex to develop a clean, dynamic, and feature-complete blog siteâ€”from frontend rendering to backend state management.

Key features include:
      Markdown-based rendering of blog posts
      Complete reactive frontend with Reflex
      Dynamic routing and post loading
      Simple file- or database-based post management
      Extensible theming, commenting, and beyond design

This repository is both a learning tool and a starting point for anyone who wants to create content-focused web apps with Reflex.
